        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Tyler Leight, and I am a full stack developer. I specialize in building Front-End, 
            Back-End, Server-Side Databases, and performing in-person IT administration.</p>
        <p>I have a strong passion for technology and love to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications. 
            My journey in programming started during my college years, where I developed a solid foundation in various 
            programming languages and technologies.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and participating 
            in coding challenges. I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends.</p>
